## Design Choices

### Typography

The font family chosen for the learn 2 lift class was [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto). It is a sans-serif font with a modern feel. Roboto is spaced out between letters so it is easier to read and has a clean style to it, making it suitable for both print and web design.

### Colour Scheme

The color scheme was chosen based on the message of the website. I wanted green as the main colour to represent wellness to relate to fitness as well as choosing a colour that was inviting as I wanted beginner friendly gym goers to feel at ease. All the colours are cool toned as I believe darker tones seemed more aggressive.

### Images

Background image is generated by ChatGPT. It displays people lifting with an instructor near by in a group using cool tones used just like the colour palette for the website. The aim was for the background image to compliment the message of the website especially with people smiling and enjoying themselves as shown in the pictures.

### Responsiveness

My website is responsive to different layouts depending on the size of the viewport have been included in the CSS media queries. This allows visitors to experience the website as I intended on device types and screen sizes. The breakpoints I am using are from Bootstrap.

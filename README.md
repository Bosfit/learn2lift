## Design Choices

### Typography

We chose [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto), a clean, sans-serif font with excellent readability. Its balanced letter spacing makes it ideal for both web and print.

### Colour Scheme

Our primary colour is a soft green to evoke wellness and approachability. All hues are cool-toned to maintain a calm, inviting feel rather than an aggressive one.

### Images

Background and illustrative images (generated via ChatGPT) depict friendly group lifting with an instructor present. The cool tones harmonize with our colour palette and reinforce a fun, supportive environment.

Favicon icons and logo used are from [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons) 

### Responsiveness

We use Bootstrap’s grid and custom media queries to ensure the layout adapts gracefully across all screen sizes:

## Design Choices

### Typography

We chose [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto), a clean, sans-serif font with excellent readability. Its balanced letter spacing makes it ideal for both web and print.

### Colour Scheme

Our primary colour is a soft green to evoke wellness and approachability. All hues are cool-toned to maintain a calm, inviting feel rather than an aggressive one.

### Images

Background and illustrative images (generated via ChatGPT) depict friendly group lifting with an instructor present. The cool tones harmonize with our colour palette and reinforce a fun, supportive environment.

Favicon icons and logo used are from [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons) 

### Responsiveness

We use Bootstrap’s grid and custom media queries to ensure the layout adapts gracefully across all screen sizes:

## Features

Layout is easy to use and navigate. It is designed in a way that everything lines up and sections are split and displayed equally. Users can easily navigate between the different sections of the website and it is kept in the same format to keep it simple to understand with access to additional features like contact information.

### Navbar

Navbar is responsive to different screen sizes with clickable features that takes you to a specific section on the website but keeps users on the same page.
